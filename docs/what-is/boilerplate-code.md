title: What is Boilerplate Code

# What is [Boilerplate Code](https://appseed.us/boilerplate-code)
---

In programming, boilerplate code is a piece of software that can be reused over and over without changing a single line of code. The whole idea behind a starter (sometimes boilerplate code) is to skip coding that piece of code common to many projects.

## Boilerplate Code Samples
---

This section presents a few samples used by AppSeed as a ground codebase to generated tested, UI-Ready simple projects. 

**Boilerplate Code Flask**

Simple starter enhanced with basic modules, database, ORM, and deployment scripts. The project has already a modern UI integrated ready to be used in a real project.
Using a tested codebase, anyone with basic programming knowledge should extend the functionalities with ease.

- UI Kit: Quick UI (Free Version) by Webpixels
- SQLite database, Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM
- Session-Based auth flow (login, register)
- Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn / Nginx, Heroku
