Pixel Pro is a premium Bootstrap 5 UI Kit without jQuery featuring over 1000 components, 50+ sections and 35 example pages including a fully fledged user dashboard - provided by **[Themesberg](https://appseed.us/agency/themesberg)**.

**1000+ Components**

Our components are a perfect extension of Bootstrap 4 so you will find it very easy to work with our code if you're familiar with their class names and styles. Furthermore, we've made sure to that all components are well documented.

**50+ Sections**

Sections are made up of components. These are the big boys and they include the navigation bars, footers, about sections, contact sections and many more.
We believe that our navigation bars are one of the most customizable ones out there. You can change the whole color scheme just by changing a letter amongst the classes.

**Accessibility**

Pixel is compliant with the latest UI design accessibility standards and passes the WAVE evaluation tool and the Achecker tool as well.
